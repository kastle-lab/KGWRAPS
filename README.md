# KGWRAPS
A Knowledge Graph-Powered Research Assistant for Polymer Science (KGWRAPS) seeks to incorporate computer-aided techniques, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), into traditional polymer science research in an attempt to accelerate the growth of the field. It has three primary functions:
1. Act as a Source of Truth (SoT) by allowing querying of relevant data,
2. Enable graph analytics by allowing analyses of polymers of based on specific properties or environmental conditions, and
3. Identify knowledge gaps and make predictions about the relationships between polymer properties and experimental conditions.
