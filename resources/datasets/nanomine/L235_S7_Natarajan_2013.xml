            <Description>The glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The samples were subjected to three temperature cycles between 25 and 130 &#176;C, with heating and cooling rates of 10 &#176;C/min. The inflection point of the heat flow curve during heating was considered the Tg. The average Tg from the second and third cycles was taken to be the Tg of the sample. The average from 2 samples was taken to be the final Tg.</Description>
